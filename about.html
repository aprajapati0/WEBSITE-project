    <h2>HISTORY</h2>
    <p>
      According to legend, William G. Morgan created the sport of volleyball in
      1895 so that individuals who found basketball's "bumping" or "jolting" to
      be too taxing would have a different physical activity to turn to. The
      ball, net, and hand-use all originated in basketball, tennis, and
      handball, respectively. While technically a volleyball match, it gained
      some competitive flavour with the addition of baseball-inspired innings,
      eventually referred to as sets. Volleyball was officially selected to
      spell as a single word in 1952. A sport that traced its origin to
      basketball, baseball, tennis and handball - and now estimated to be played
      by over 800 million globally - had thus been established.

    <h2>VOLLEYBALL POSTIONS</h2>
    <p>
      The specific responsibilities that players play on the court while playing
      volleyball are known as positions. They are divided into three main
      groups: setters, offence, and defence. On the court, each position is
      given a designated spot that is fixed and never moves. For instance,
      outside hitters often occupy the fourth location on the court, which is
      the left front-court position. There are six specific spots on the
      volleyball court that are identified by their numbers, such as "the 5
      positions." Coaches typically want to have at least two players for every
      position on their teams to enable for substitutions throughout the game.
      Hence, volleyball teams typically field a team of 10 to 14 players.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main positions in volleyball are Setter (S), Outside Hitter (OH),
      Opposite Hitter (Opp or RS), Libero (L), and Middle Blocker (MB or MH).
      The setter (S) is responsible for distributing the ball to their
      teammates. A libero is specialized in passing the ball, setting the ball
      from the back row, playing defense. The outside hitter (OH) aka Pin hitter
      is responsible for attacking the ball from the front row and playing
      defense from the back row. The opposite hitter (Opp/RS) (also known as a
      right-side hitter) is typically the second attacker and is responsible for
      hitting the ball from the back row. The middle blocker (MH) aka middle
      hitter is responsible for blocking shots at the net and attacking the ball
      in the front row. The other two postions is called Defensive Specialists
      and Serving Specialist. Defensive Specialists are much like a libero, a
      defensive specialist plays in the back row and is responsible for playing
      defense and receiving serve. A serving specialist is a player who subs in
      just to serve. These players typically have a very tough or very
      consistent serve, and they come in for a player who is less strong.
